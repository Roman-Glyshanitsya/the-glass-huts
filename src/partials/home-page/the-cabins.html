        <p class="cabins__text">
          Løvtag’s three exclusive and comfortable cabins, Et, Ro and Ly, are designed by architect Sigurd Larsen. They
          all have an open space with a double bed, a double sofa bed, kitchen, separate toilet and an outdoor shower.
          On the roof, surrounded by treetops, there is a terrace, which is about nine meters above ground. The cottages
          are built around tall, old trees that go through the entire cottage from floor to ceiling.
